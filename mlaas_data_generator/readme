# MLaaS Data Generator

This package converts the original `MLaaS_Data_Generator.ipynb` notebook into a small
Python package.  The goal is to provide a repeatable way to generate synthetic
client records for experiments with Adaptive MLaaS.

The generator performs a lightweight federated-learning loop. Local model
weights for each client and the aggregated global weights are written to a
`weights/` directory for every round.

## Usage

```bash
python -m mlaas_data_generator.cli --clients 5 --dataset fashion_mnist --distribution custom_distributions.json --output clients.csv                             
```

The command downloads the Fashion-MNIST dataset, trains a small model for each

Use `--clients *num_clients*` to specify the number of clients wanted.
Use `--dataset *dataset_name*` to switch to the specified dataset.
Specify `--distribution custom_distributions.json` to use a custom distributed dataset.
use `--output *filename*.csv` to specify the output files name. 


The command downloads the chosen dataset, trains a small model for each
client and writes the resulting metrics into `clients.csv`.
