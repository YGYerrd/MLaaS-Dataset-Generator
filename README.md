# Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) Dataset Generator
Framework for IoT Environments

We propose a novel MLaaS Dataset Generator (MDG) framework
that creates configurable and reproducible datasets for evaluating
Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) selection and composition.
MDG simulates realistic MLaaS behaviour by training and evaluat-
ing diverse model families across multiple real-world datasets and
data distribution settings. It records detailed functional attributes,
quality of service metrics, and composition-specific indicators, en-
abling systematic analysis of service performance and cross-service
behaviour. Using MDG, we generate more than ten thousand MLaaS
service instances and construct a large-scale benchmark dataset
suitable for downstream evaluation. We also implement a built-in
composition mechanism that models how services interact under
varied Internet of Things conditions. Experiments demonstrate
that datasets generated by MDG enhance selection accuracy and
composition quality compared to existing baselines. MDG provides
a practical and extensible foundation for advancing data-driven
research on MLaaS selection and composition
