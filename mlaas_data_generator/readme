# MLaaS Data Generator

This package converts the original `MLaaS_Data_Generator.ipynb` notebook into a small
Python package.  The goal is to provide a repeatable way to generate synthetic
client records for experiments with Adaptive MLaaS.

## Usage

```bash
python -m mlaas_data_generator.cli --clients 5 --output clients.csv #for review
```

The command downloads the Fashion-MNIST dataset, trains a small model for each
client and writes the resulting metrics (including the binary utility scores)
into `clients.csv`.
